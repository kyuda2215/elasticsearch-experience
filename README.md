# Elasticsearch Experience
Howdy! This repo is intended to keep all my notes and everything I have learned about Elasticsearch. Hope this guide and lesson is useful for you!

If you just want to get pointers on how to query elasticsearch, check out these files:
- crud.md
- index_and_mapping.md

There are more to come so stay tuned!!
